jules

first we do 
frida-trace -i "CreateFileA" -i "WriteFile" -f ./bininst2.exe

problem with createfile: path is wrong. fix it
problem with writefile: idk but u can just get the string
and for some dumb ass reason it only works SOMETIMES????

anyway just edit the generated code thingies after running the frida-trace and just keep running it till ut works idk lol
